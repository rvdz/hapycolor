    Partition Around Medoids

        The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the average dissimilarity of
        objects to their closest selected object.
        A k-medoid algorithm was chosen instead of a regular k-means, since it
        is often useful to have a color representing a cluster of colors that
        is also contained in the picture. The algorithm is divided in two
        steps: the build phase, and the swap phase.

    Build

        A collection of k objects are selected for an initial set S

    Swap

        The second phase, SWAP, attempts to improve the the set of selected
        object :math:`selected` and, therefore, to improve the quality of the
        clustering. This is done by considering all pairs :math:`(i, h)` where
        :math:`i` in :math:`selected` and :math:`h` in :math:`unselected` and
        consists of computing the effect :math:`T_{ih}` on the sum of
        dissimilarities between objects and the closest selected object caused
        by swapping :math:`i` and :math:`h`, that is, by transferring :math:`i`
        from :math:`selected` to :math:`unselected` and transferring :math:`h`
        from :math:`unselected` to :math:`selected`. The computation of
        :math:`T_{ih}` involves the computation of the contribution
        :math:`K_{jih}` of each object :math:`j \in unselected − {h}` to the
        swap of :math:`i` and :math:`h`. Note that we have either
        :math:`d(j, i) > D_j` or :math:`d(j, i) = D_j`.
